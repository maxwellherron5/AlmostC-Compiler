# Maxwell Herron's JFlex scanner project

This project used the JFlex meta-programming language to generate a custom java scanner class that will be able to 
tokenize inputs from a file and determine what they are. To run this program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo
2. In your terminal, enter the scanner folder and run the command
`java -jar jflex.jar scanner.jflex`.
3. Now compile the generated file by entering `javac MyScanner.java`.
4. To run the test of it in main, simply enter `javac Main.java` followed by
`java Main`.
5. Enjoy!
